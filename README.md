# Estyma for Home Assistant

Integrate your heating system into Home Assistant \
All Systems, that are provided by Estyma.pl should be supported. \
I know that Igneo.pl and bia21.net both work. 

If you find more domains, please test, if it works.
I will add those to the list.

### Performance
I know that changing settings is really slow. \
The issue lies with their backend. \
There is nothing i can do about that.

## Installation

Add Tabisch/Estyma_ha_integration to your integrations in hacs.

## Configuartion

Use your login Credentials to add the Integration. \
You can set the language for the output by typing the following in the language field. \
The list of languages maybe incomplete, because the backend i use may add languages over time.

german \
polish \
romanian \
english \
french \
danish \
russian \
czech \
spanish \
hungarian \
slovak
